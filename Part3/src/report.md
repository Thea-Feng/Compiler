### Q1: Resolve Ambiguity for Micro Languageâ€™s Grammar

#### 1. Counter-Example for Ambiguity
Example: `ID PLUOP ID MINUSOP ID` could be parsed in at least two different ways. The first way is to parse it as `(ID PLUOP ID) MINUSOP ID`, and the second way is to parse it as `ID PLUOP (ID MINUSOP ID)`.

#### 2. LL(1) Parsing Table Ambiguity Clarification
- **(a)** **Yes**. This is because LL(1) grammars require a single production rule to be applicable for any given non-terminal and input symbol combination. Multiple entries for the same combination suggest that the parser has more than one way to proceed, which may lead to ambiguity.

- **(b)** **No**. Ambiguity could arise in situations not covered by the table, especially in grammars that are not strictly LL(1) or involve more complex constructs not captured by the table. (?)

### Q2  Simple LL(1) and LR(0) Parsing Exercises

#### LL(1) Grammar Modification
- **1. Modify the Grammar**: To make the given grammar LL(1), we need to eliminate left recursion and apply left factoring where necessary. Refactored grammar (expressed by the format from Princeton web demo):

    ```
    E ::= T E'
    E' ::= + E 
    T ::= int T' 
    T ::= ( E )
    T' ::= * T 
    E' ::= ''
    T' ::= ''
    ```

- **3. Parse Tree**:

#### LR(0) Grammar Exploration
- **1. Default LR(0) Grammar**: The exploration of the default LR(0) grammar using the web demo will involve understanding the LR(0) automaton, including its table and DFA diagram.

- **2. LL(1) and LR(0) Compatibility**
  - The demo of default LR(0) grammar will show that it is not LL(1) compatible.
  - The demo of default LL(1) grammar will show that it is not LR(1) compatible.
  - Why LL(1) demo is not LR(0): Potential Shift-Reduce Conflict
  
    The conflict most likely occurs with the handling of the + and * operators, which are part of E' and T' respectively. 

    For example, conflict at + in E':

    When the parser encounters + after processing an id (for example, in the input id +), it faces a decision:
    Shift: considering more input could lead to recognizing a longer pattern like + T E'.
    Reduce: based on T ::= F T' and F ::= id, the parser could decide to reduce the already read id to F, then T, and potentially start reducing E ::= T E'.
    However, without lookahead (as in LR(0)), the parser cannot decide based solely on the current state and the + symbol whether to shift or reduce.

### Q3: Implement LL(1) Parser by hand for Oat v.1
  - Compile:
    ```
    g++ main.cpp -o main -std=c++11
    ```
  - Excute:
    ```
    ./main ${rule_file}$ ${lexer_file}$ 
    ``` 
  - Example: test0-tokens.txt
    ```
    ./main input.txt test0-tokens.txt
    ``` 

    The program will print the steps similar to web demo
    ```
